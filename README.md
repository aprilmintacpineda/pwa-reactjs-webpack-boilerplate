# pwa-reactjs-webpack-boilerplate

A boilerplate for your **Progressive Web App (PWA)** with **react-js**, **material-ui**, **fluxible-js**, and **react-fluxible** using **webpack** with S3 Static Hosting built-in support. Also has built-in code formatting using **eslint**, **prettier**. Codes will be formatted on commit using **husky** and **lint-staged**.

# Getting started

## Install

- `git clone git@github.com:aprilmintacpineda/pwa-reactjs-webpack-boilerplate.git`
- Rename folder to `<your_project>` -- `mv pwa-reactjs-webpack-boilerplate <your_project>`
- `cd <your_project>`
- Delete the `.git` directory because you won't need it -- `rm -rf .git`
- Change name, description, author, and license on `package.json`.
- `npm i` -- Optionally you can use **npm-check** and do `npm-check -u` to update and install the dependencies.

## favicons

You can use [favicon-generator.org](https://www.favicon-generator.org/) to generate the images you'll need for the favicon. Replace the `assets/images/favicon.icon` with the generated one and replace the matching file names on `/assets/images/icons`.

## Manifest icons

For the manifest icons and the `manifest.json`, you can use [Manifest generator](https://app-manifest.firebaseapp.com/). After downloading the zip file, replace all images in `/assets/images/manifest-icons` with the images from `images/icons` included in the zip file.

Edit the `manifest.json` file and change the `name`, `short_name`, etc., but you don't need to change the `icons`

# Development

All JS files are in `src` folder, start by going to `src/entry.js` which is the main entry point for webpack. To start development run `npm run dev` which will start up a dev-server and open up a window for you. Then you can make changes to the files in `src`, the opened window will automatically refresh when changes were made.

# Production

To build for production just do `npm run build`. It will generate a production build of your app in `build` directory, this directory is ready to be deployed to production. If you want to preview the production build, you can do so with `npm run serve`. Running `npm run start` will do both of these commands.

## Uploading to S3

The boilerplate supports uploading the build to an S3 bucket.

1. Create S3 bucket and enable static file hosting.
2. Rename `configs/uploadToS3.example.js` to `configs/uploadToS3.js` -- `mv configs/uploadToS3.example.js configs/uploadToS3.js`.
3. Create an IAM user with programmatic access to be used for the uploader, and get the `access key id` and `secret access key` and put those in the `configs/uploadToS3.js` files.
4. do `npm run build` and then `npm run uploadToS3` -- or you can also do `npm run deployToS3` which will do both.

#### Parameters

- `--env=dev` is the target env to deploy to as defined in the config.

#### Notes:

- Your old files will be deleted after successful uploads, this is to ensure that the bucket is clean because the build is using hash generated by webpack as filenames. Files that has similar names (not using hash) **WILL NOT BE DELETED**.
- All files other than images will be compressed using gzip before upload, this will allow S3 hosting to serve these files as gzip to minimize the file size being transfered.
